<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Sujan Bajracharya. Currently I am working as a Tennis coach. I have been coaching for more
  than five years. I work in different cities on different days.
  I work Monday through Friday in Palo Alto, Saturday in Redwood City and Sunday in Foster City.
</p>

<p>I always wanted to be a web developer. So I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  I will try my best to become a web developer in the near future.
